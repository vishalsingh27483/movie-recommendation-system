- *Machine Learning*: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to find similarities between movies.
- *Scalability*: Can be extended to include more features and handle larger datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [TMDB Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) from Kaggle. It contains detailed information about movies, including metadata such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. *Clone the repository*:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivang-Patel/Movie-Recommendor-System.git
   cd files
   


2. *Download the dataset*:
   Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) and place it in the data/ directory.

## Usage

1. *Run the Jupyter notebook*:
   Open and run the Movie_Recommender.ipynb file to train the model and generate recommendations.

2. *Start the application*:
   bash
   streamlit run app.py
   

3. *Get recommendations*:
   Select a movie from the dropdown menu and click "Recommend" to get a list of similar movies.
